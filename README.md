# *Javascript Rules!*

The main purpose of this game is to go over basic theory encompassing JavaScript. Since this is my first project I not only wanted to build code from the ground up for the experience, but also as a way to freshen up on my understanding so far in the first weeks of class. 

I decided to frame the quiz questions the same way I frame my notes: 

* What is this
* Why is this important
* When will I use it

This is meant to be a beginner-friendly review of the concepts of JavaScript syntax. Therefore the game instructions are meant to be simple, get at least 9 answers correct to pass.

## *Post-MVP Work*

As I learn more programming languages in the future, I plan on making similar games such as this one. The game can be a great tool for juniors such as myself and provide a hands-on exercise to further instill the practices at hand. However since this is *only* just my first project, I didn't have the liberty to be as creative as I wanted. Once that happens, here's some ideas I'd like to add in the near future:

* More questions specifically asking how to write the syntax
* True/false questions
* Matching answers
* Jeopardy-style score system
* More categories
* Explanations for wrong answers
* Higher-fidelity UI
* And more!


## In Conclusion

If you made it this far, then I would like to thank you for taking the time out of your day to view my project! Remember, ***Javascript Rules!***
